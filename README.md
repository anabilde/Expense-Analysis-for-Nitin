## Process

### 1. Data Collection
- Gathered two sets of raw data: 
  - **June Expense Data**: Detailed list of daily expenses.
  - **6-Month Expense Data**: Summary of monthly expenses for six months.
  
### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Organized the raw data in Excel, ensuring consistency and removing any errors.
- Split the data into **essential** and **non-essential** categories based on necessity.

### 3. Expense Breakdown (Dashboard 1)
- Created a **Pivot Table** to summarize the June expenses by category.
- Analyzed the percentage spent on each category, identifying **Grocery** as the highest spending area and **Entertainment/Shopping** as potential savings areas.
- Created charts to visually represent the highest and second-highest categories for further comparison.

### 4. Six-Month Trend Analysis (Dashboard 2)
- Analyzed expense trends across six months to identify patterns of high spending.
- Compared the total spend across categories like Grocery, Entertainment, and Tickets & Bills.
- Used graphs and charts to highlight the most expensive months and categories, with **February** having the highest spend.

### 5. Insights and Recommendations
- Identified categories with unnecessary spending, such as **Movies**, **Online Food Orders**, and **Shopping**.
- Suggested cutting down on non-essential expenses (e.g., limiting movie outings, reducing online food orders).
- Calculated potential savings of ₹3,550 in June if Nitin reduced spending in these areas.

### 6. Presentation Creation
- Designed a PowerPoint presentation summarizing all findings, recommendations, and data visualizations for easy understanding.
- Included specific strategies to optimize Nitin's spending habits and maximize his savings.
